        Calculate the similarity score between the query and each document
        Use the formula:

        similarity(query, document) = (inner product of query terms and document terms ) / (length of query vector * length of document vector)

        The upper part of the fraction is the inner product or dot product of the vectors (check out the Wikipedia article if you are not familiar with this). It is computed by multiplying the two weights for the same terms (one weight comes from each vector), and adding these products together.
        The denominator contains the product of the norms of the two vectors. The norm of a vector is computed by creating the sum of all squares of each weight inside the vector, and taking the square root in the end.
        and where the length of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of the vector elements.
