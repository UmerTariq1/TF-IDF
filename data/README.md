The complete data file (nyt199501.xml) was too big (45 mb) to be uploaded on github so its compressed file is uploaded here. 
nytsmall is just a small version of the original data.


Note that in the data the structure was generally followed that document will be inside the TEXT->P tag. but for some documents there isnt any P tag and the document text is directly placed in the TEXT tag. This is handled by data handler class
